# Login Input Sanitization Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the input sanitization and validation implemented for the login authentication process in the TSA2 application.

## Implementation Details

### Location
- **File**: `app/Controllers/Login.php`
- **Method**: `authenticate()`

### Validation Rules

#### Email Field
- **Rule**: `required|valid_email|max_length[255]`
- **Purpose**: 
  - Ensures email is provided
  - Validates proper email format (prevents injection attacks)
  - Limits length to prevent buffer overflow attempts
- **Error Messages**:
  - `required`: "Email is required"
  - `valid_email`: "Please provide a valid email address"
  - `max_length`: "Email must not exceed 255 characters"

#### Password Field
- **Rule**: `required|min_length[8]|max_length[255]`
- **Purpose**:
  - Ensures password is provided
  - Enforces minimum security requirement (8 characters)
  - Limits length to prevent buffer overflow attempts
- **Error Messages**:
  - `required`: "Password is required"
  - `min_length`: "Password must be at least 8 characters"
  - `max_length`: "Password must not exceed 255 characters"

## Security Benefits

1. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing
2. **Email Format Checking**: Prevents email injection attacks
3. **Length Limits**: Prevents buffer overflow and DoS attempts
4. **Early Validation**: Validation occurs before database queries, reducing load
5. **Framework Security**: Uses CodeIgniter's built-in validation (tested and secure)
6. **User Feedback**: Clear error messages without leaking sensitive information

## Error Handling

- Validation errors are displayed using flash messages
- Multiple validation errors are combined into a single message
- Users are redirected back to the login form with their email preserved
- Passwords are never preserved in the form (security best practice)

## Testing

Unit tests are provided in `tests/unit/LoginControllerTest.php` covering:
- Invalid email format
- Empty email
- Short password (< 8 characters)
- Empty password
- Valid input format

## Usage Example

### Valid Login Attempt
```
Email: user@example.com
Password: SecurePass123!

Result: Validation passes, authentication proceeds
```

### Invalid Login Attempts

#### Invalid Email Format
```
Email: invalid-email
Password: SecurePass123!

Result: Error - "Please provide a valid email address"
```

#### Short Password
```
Email: user@example.com
Password: Short1!

Result: Error - "Password must be at least 8 characters"
```

#### Empty Fields
```
Email: (empty)
Password: (empty)

Result: Error - "Email is required Password is required"
```

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing redirect behavior is preserved
- Session handling remains unchanged
- Flash message system works as before
- User input preservation (except passwords) continues to work

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:
- Rate limiting for login attempts
- CAPTCHA integration for repeated failures
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Two-factor authentication support
